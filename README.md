# Alexa-shit-skill
A shitty skill for Alexa challenges

~~Doesn't work yet!~~
**It works, finally!**

**TODO / fix-list :**
- [X] Dataset is too big and the skill run out of time, so Alexa stops.
- [X] Hosting dataset on a database, and asking a random fact from there.
- [ ] Create a custom APL JSON file, from scratch.
- [ ] Find something to create dinamically an APL JSON, better than what I have done.
- [ ] Look for bugs, clear code and un-shit the shit

STATE: *In review*
